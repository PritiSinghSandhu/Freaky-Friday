                            "Meditation isn’t about becoming a different person, a new person, or even a better
                            person. It’s about training in awareness and getting a healthy sense of perspective.
                            You’re not trying to turn off your thoughts or feelings. You’re learning to observe them
                            without judgment. And eventually, you may start to better understand them as well." </p>

                     <p> There are actually differents ways to perform different types of meditation. However, there are
                       no right or wrong ways to do it. This is the beauty of meditation. You have all the freedom to
                       do it as you like it. What matters the most is that you are comfortable to carry it out and
                       that you get the results you want.

                      have written a detailed article about how to meditate. You do not need to do everything that is
                      explained in this article. Nor do you need to do something in the exact way it is described.
                      You should however use it as a guidance to reach your goal, which is to meditate.

                     <p> As mentioned in the last paragraph, there is no right or wrong ways to meditate. Further on, there
                       is not any specific time to do it. Again, you have all the right to decide yourself when you want
                       to meditate. You do not have time to meditate on sunday? No worries, do it when you have time.
                       Are you tired today and do not have the capacity to meditate? No problem, do it when you have the
                       energy to do it. The main point with this, is that you are your own boss. The vital part is that you
                       actually do it and enjoy it.
